Scrying (S): The Scrying spell is used to see what is happening
somewhere else, right now. Scrying into the past is very
difficult, and scrying into the future is just as risky as any
other form of fortune-telling; do not depend upon it!
A perfect reflective surface is required, and some mirrors
are enchanted for better scrying, but other things can be
used:
• A silver bowl of clear water, for quick visions only.
• A cauldron of molten silver or other white metal. Lead
has terribly poisonous fumes, and mercury has its own
hazards, but either can be used in a pinch. Gallium works
if you can find it!
• A perfectly flat and freshly polished sheet of solid silver.
Beware; the iron law of scrying is that “He who sees is
seen.” Any scrying tool can open you to the occult vision
of others. Therefore, the experienced wizard will empty his
silver bowl, cover his mirror, or let his gallium cool to a
rough surface!
Roll vs. IQ, not DX. Scrying is difficult, requiring at
least a 4/IQ roll. Add 1 die if the target is within wards or
a pentagram. Add 1 die if there is an unbroken protective
ring of silver around the place you seek to see.
However, ignore all wards, and subtract 1 die, if there is
a mirror or scrying tool in the place you are trying to see.
The extent of the vision depends on the margin by which
the roll is made:
1-2 Quick glimpse, vision only. If you fear your
mastery is too great and don’t want to spend
strength, use a bowl of water as your mirror
and your success will be only at this level.
3-4 Ten seconds of sound with a single static
image.
5-6 Thirty seconds, sound only, or three seconds
of vision – your choice.
7-8 One minute, sound only, or ten seconds of
vision – your choice.
9 or 10 One minute, vision and sound.
11 and up Three minutes, vision and sound.
Only one attempt per subject per day. ST cost is equal
to the margin of success, so a quick glimpse costs little but
a detailed vision may leave the caster unconscious (never
dead).
Slippery Floor (T): Makes the floor over one megahex
extremely slick. When any figure enters the slippery area,
the player who cast the spell reveals it. Any figure in a hex
made slippery, or any figure entering a slippery hex, must
make his saving roll (3 dice against DX) to avoid falling
in that hex. If the figure then enters another slippery hex in
the same turn, it must roll again, and so on . . . and even if
a figure simply stands still in a slippery hex, it must make
the saving roll to avoid falling. A figure which falls in a
slippery hex may try to stand next turn, but must make
its 3-die DX roll to do so. Of course, it may choose to lie
still, or to crawl out (see Crawling under Movement). This
requires no DX roll.
To figure the range for this spell, or any other thrown
spell covering one MH, count the hexes from the wizard to
the center of the MH involved; this is the DX penalty. This
spell does affect images and illusions. Lasts 12 turns unless
renewed. Cost: 3 ST.
Staff III/Staff of Striking (S): Like Staff II, except that its
occult attack may strike a figure two hexes away in any
direction from the wizard, and the to-hit roll is made at
DX+3.
Also, the staff’s occult attack now bypasses the armor
or natural defense of its target. Magical defenses such as
Stone Flesh still operate.
Sticky Floor (T): Makes an area of floor 1 MH in size
magically “sticky.” The only effect is on figures’ movement.
Any figure entering a “sticky” floor area stops immediately.
Each turn thereafter, his MA is reduced to l. A figure with
a ST over 30 has MA 2. An area cannot be both “slippery”
and “sticky” due to magic; the second spell cast will fail to
work. This spell affects images and illusions. This effect
lasts 12 turns unless renewed. Cost: 3 ST.
Stone Flesh (T): Gives subject’s body the power to act as
armor, stopping 4 hits per attack. The protective effect of
Stone Flesh is cumulative with any other natural or magical
hit-stopping ability (armor, fur, etc.) of its possessor, but
not with Iron or Diamond Flesh. There is no way to tell
if a figure is protected by this spell except to hit it or use
Reveal Magic. Costs 2 ST to cast, plus 1 each turn the spell
continues.
Stop (T): The victim of this spell has a MA of zero for the
next four turns. He or she may do anything else, but may
not move to another hex under any circumstances. Cost:
3 ST.
Summon Gargoyle (C): Brings a regular Gargoyle (ST 20,
DX 11, IQ 8, MA 8 on ground, 16 in air, fist does 2 dice
damage, skin stops 3 hits) to serve wizard. (See Summoned
Creatures.) Costs 4 ST, plus 1 each turn the Gargoyle stays.
